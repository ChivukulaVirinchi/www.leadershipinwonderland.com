                            <h2 class="h2-responsive">Sally Sparrow Learns a Lesson</h2>
                            <hr> <p>Once upon a time, in the city under the arch, there lived the Sparrow family. There was mom and dad Sparrow along with brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles, cousins, and grandparents all living and working together. They had a good system of helping one another look for food, and watching out for danger. They were a team, and they made a good living feasting on the bits of hotdog buns and potato chips dropped by the tourists. In fact, the Sparrows were so prosperous that they moved into the trees bordering the arch and didn’t even bother with the fodder that their poor relations were forced to eat.</p>

<p>Then one year, the rains came and it didn’t seem as though they would ever stop. The river rose, and there was a flood that scared the tourists away. Gone were the tasty morsels that the Sparrows had grown accustomed to. Gone, too, was the easy life that had come to expected. It was apparent that if things didn’t change, the family would be forced to leave their precious roost and return to the humble ways they thought they had left behind forever.</p>

<p>It was with these dire conditions facing the family that Sally Sparrow, the youngest of the Sparrow children, spied a piece of candy on the steps in the distance. She couldn’t believe her good fortune, and was quick to alert the other members of the family. As was their norm, they all flew to investigate. Some perched on the surrounding steps to keep a watchful eye out for possible threats while the others flew to nibble at the tasty morsel. It was their practice to then exchange positions so that each family member would have a chance to eat some of the bounty.</p>

<p>However, Sally Sparrow was in no mood to share. She couldn’t believe that they were going to steal her treasure! Seeing this she squawked at the other birds, scolding them for their audacity. It never entered her mind that everyone else had shared with her in the past. She flapped her wings and flew at her relations in anger, chastising them for their bad behavior each time someone approached what she considered HER food. Soon the other birds grew weary of her treatment and decided to leave her to feast alone. As they began to hop away, Sally got frightened. There was no one left to watch her back as she ate. There wasn’t even anyone around to whom she could gloat about finding such a treasure. She didn’t like to be alone, and quickly hopped after the others pleading for them to come back.</p>

<p>Thinking that Sally had seen the folly in her behavior, the family returned and fell into their normal routine. However, no sooner had several other birds joined her than she once again squawked and flew at them in anger. Evidently, Sally wanted the benefits of being part of a team, but she didn’t want the responsibilities.  She was a selfish sparrow! Seeing this, the others once again withdrew.</p>

<p>True to form, Sally couldn’t abide being left alone, and she again flew after them begging them to come back. However, the others didn’t believe her pleas. They turned a deaf ear to her and returned to their trees. This left Sally two options: to stay and enjoy her treat, risking exposure to whatever dangers might be lurking, or she could forfeit the treasure and return home with her family. Perhaps it was with a better understanding of the value of teamwork that she chose to go with her family.</p>
